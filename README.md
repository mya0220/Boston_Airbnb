###################Motivations(Business Questions)##########

Q1: Is there any special pattern of 'busy' season where occupancy rate is significantly higher than usual?\n
Q2: does this 'busy' season pattern different among different areas of the city?
Q3: Where's the most expensive area?

######################Conclusions#############

There's no clear sign that weekends has higher booking rate. However, there are few 'special weekends' we can see spike of booking rate during weekends. The busy pattern is not the same for all neighborhoods, although most of them share similar patterns. The most expensive area is Harvard Square.
